## Security Notes

- This project is **strictly for Testnet use**
- API keys should be stored securely (environment variables recommended for production)
- No real funds are involved

---

## Possible Improvements

- WebSocket-based live price streaming
- CLI-only mode (headless execution)
- Strategy layer (Grid / TWAP)
- Environment-based configuration management
